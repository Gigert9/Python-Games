A bunch of simple Python games. 

Followed a handy tutorial compilation video from freeCodeCamp.org to make each of these games. They're essentially copy/paste. All of this was done in an effort to learn and play with Python.

**PLEASE NOTE:
    For Tetris to funciton properly, you will need to ensure the 'tetris_scores.txt' file has also been downloaded to the same local folder. Alternatively, a text file with the same name will need to be created and a single integer value placed in the first line. If you'd like to change the name of the file, please review the code itself, however it should be noted that without fulfilling this requirement Tetris will not work correctly.
