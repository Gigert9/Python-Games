# Python Games

I followed a handy tutorial compilation video from freeCodeCamp.org to make each of the following games. The code has been retyped as per each tutorial in an effor to further my knowledge of the Python language by using pygame.

## Installation

It's suggested to clone the entire github repo for playing locally, however it is possible to pull some of the individual games. Pong, Snake, and Connect Four will all work independently.

### Tetris

For Tetris to funciton properly, you will need to ensure the 'tetris_scores.txt' file has also been downloaded to the same local folder. Alternatively, a text file with the same name will need to be created and a single integer value placed in the first line. If you'd like to change the name of the file, please review the code itself, however it should be noted that without fulfilling this requirement Tetris will not work correctly.

### Online_Game_v1

A current work in progress, this is not quite a 'game' so much as an experiment in creating online connectivity through Python via sockets. The code works, but will require some configuration to run locally. If interested, please reference the code and insert the appropriate IP address before executing.
